# FIFA - Player & Market Analysis

Analyzing player prices, attributes and statistics.

Credits to [S. Leone](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-19-fifa-ultimate-team/version/1) for the original dataframe and [futbin.com](www.futbin.com). 

Through web scraping, the original dataframe was updated by fetching the attributes and prices of new players from futbin. The [database_build](https://github.com/cvaf/fut/blob/master/database_build.ipynb) notebook provides instructions for updating the dataframe. All relevant scraping functions can be found in db_functions.py

The market_analysis notebook contains a few visualizations on price trends and reaction of complementary players.
